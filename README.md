# Spark: Crowdfunding for a Cause
Swift Hack made for the 2015 Money2020 Hackathon.

## Pitch Summary

While the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge increased awareness for Lou Gehrig's disease, other charitable organizations suffered significant losses in donations. Spark aims to take the concept of crowdfunding for a cause and extend the reach to any cause and any challenge. Using a social platform to post videos and pictures highlighting challenges, Spark allows users to 'spark' their friends to accept a challenge or donate to a cause - or maybe even both! Donations are accepted through MasterCard's API. All in all, Spark utilizes technology to ignite the path towards a better world.

## API
MasterCard Mobile Payment SDK
